OMERO clients overview
======================

Most laboratories use a number of different imaging platforms and thus
require tools to manage, visualise and analyse heterogeneous sets of
image data recorded in a range of file formats. OMERO provides a single 
application, running on a user's laptop or workstation, which can access
all sets of data, and provide easy-to-use access to this data.

OMERO provides a central storage server application called the **OMERO.server**
(the OMERO server is located at the Biozentrum) and a series of clients. The client readily available to
users at the Biozentrum is **OMERO.insight**.
All the OMERO clients run on the major operating systems (Windows, Apple, and Linux) and provide image visualisation,
management, and annotation to users from remote locations. With a large number of OMERO.server installations worldwide, OMERO has been shown to be
easy to install and get running.

**OMERO.clients** is the collective term for the OME applications that allows
users access to their data in the **OMERO.server**. 

OMERO.insight are desktop applications written in Java
and require Java 1.5 (or higher) to be installed on the user's computer
(automatically installed on most up-to-date OS X and Windows XP systems).

.. 	OMERO.web
	---------

..
	OMERO.web is a web-based client for users who wish to access their data in the
	browser. This offers a similar view to the OMERO.insight desktop client
	Figures :ref:`omeroweb_44` and :ref:`omero_web_4_4` present the user
	interface [2]_ [4]_. Developers can use the |OmeroWeb| to build customised views.

OMERO.insight
-------------

OMERO.insight provides a number of tools for accessing and using data in an OMERO Server. 
The figure :ref:`omero_insight_4_4_viewer` presents the OMERO.insight image viewer, whereas figure :ref:`omero_insight_screenshot_4_4`
presents the user interface [1]_ [2]_. To find out more, see :doc:`clients-getting-started`.

Among many features, the noteworthy OMERO.insight elements are:

- DataManager, a traditional tree-based view of the data hierarchies in an
  OMERO Server. DataManager supports access to all image metadata,
  annotations, tags.
- ImageViewer, for visualisation of 5D images (space, channel, time). The
  ImageViewer makes use of the OMERO Server's Rendering Engine, and provides
  high-performance viewing of multi-dimensional images on standard
  workstations (e.g. scrolling through space and time), without requiring
  installation of high-powered graphics cards. Most importantly, image viewing
  at remote locations is enabled. Image rendering settings are saved and
  chosen by user ID.
- Measurement Tool, a sub-application of ImageViewer that enables size and
  intensity measurements of defined regions-of-interest (ROIs).
- Working Area, for viewing, annotating, and manipulating large sets of image
  data.
- User administration.
- Image import.



.. _omero-importer:

OMERO.importer
--------------

The OMERO.importer is part of the OMERO.insight client, but can also run as a
stand-alone application. The OMERO.importer allows the import of proprietary
image data files from a filesystem accessed from the user's computer to a
running OMERO Server. This tool uses a standard file browser to select the
image files to an OMERO Server. For a full tutorial, please see
:doc:`client-tutorials/insight/insight-import`.

The tool uses Bio-Formats for translation of proprietary file formats in
preparation for upload to an OMERO Server. Visit :bf_doc:`Supported Formats <supported-formats.html>`
for a detailed list of supported formats.
