Overview of OMERO
=================

OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a modern client-server software platform
for visualising, managing, and annotating scientific image data. OMERO
also provides components for image importing, archiving, protocol
recording, and user administration. See the OMERO :feature_plone:`feature list

The suite of Java-based tools for data visualisation and management, the
OMERO clients, is cross-platform. To run on your computer they require
Java 1.5 or 1.6 be installed. This is included with most modern systems
and is an easy install for others from http://java.com/en.

The OMERO.insight client gets all of its information from a remote OMERO
server â€” the location of the server is specified at login. Since this
connection utilises a standard network connection, the client can be run
anytime the user is connected to the internet.

There are a number of demonstration videos available on the
:feature_plone:`Features List <>` page providing an
overview of the applications. For an initial impression please browse
our :omero_plone:`screenshots <screenshots>`. For a detailed
overview of the OMERO clients, see the :doc:`/users/clients-overview`.

This documentation is for the latest version of the OMERO Platform. We
also have archived versions available for :legacy_plone:`legacy versions of
OMERO <support/legacy/>`.

Most other **technical documentation** is located on the developer
maintained `Trac system <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/>`_.
