The suite of Java-based tools for data visualisation and management, the
OMERO clients, is cross-platform. To run on your computer, it requires
Java 1.5 or 1.6 be installed. This is included with most modern systems
and is an easy install for others from http://java.com/en.

The OMERO.insight client gets all of its information from a remote OMERO
server based at the Biozentrum â€” the details of the server is specified at login. Since this
connection utilises a standard network connection, the OMERO.insight client can be run
anytime as long as the user is connected to the internet.

There are a number of demonstration videos available on the
:feature_plone:`Features List <>` page providing an
overview of the applications. For an initial impression, please browse
