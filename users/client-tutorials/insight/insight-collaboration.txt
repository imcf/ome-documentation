Viewing rendering settings by group members
-------------------------------------------

When viewing your images OMERO provides the ability to switch between your own rendering settings of the image and view the rendering settings of 
the other members of the laboratory who have viewed the image and applied their own rendering settings. 

|

#. Click on an image to open the image viewer. 

   Click on the **Saved By** icon to display the rendering controls. 
 
   Clicking this icon provides a list of user names who have viewed the image.

   .. note:: **Please note** that the **Saved By** list will only be populated if other members of your laboratory group have viewed your image.
   
   
#. Clicking on the different names in the list allows you to view your image with the rendering settings used by that user.

#. To save the rendering settings of someone who has viewed your image you may click on the **save the current settings** icon. 

   OMERO also provides the ability to copy and paste rendering settings of an image across  multiple images. This is described in the copy and paste rendering settings in`Viewing images`_. 

   Alternatively you can close the image viewer and choose **not** to save any changes made to the rendering settings to the image.
